# IP-Address-Checker

I completed a Python programming project that involved working with IPv4 addresses. In this project, asking the user to input 10 IPv4 addresses, checking if the addresses were valid, and converting the decimal format addresses to binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats using built-in functions and libraries.

I created a list to hold the converted addresses in decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats, and then transferred the contents of the list to a file named conversion.txt. Finally, I printed the converted IP addresses in the desired format on the screen.

This project helped me to improve my Python programming skills and gain experience in working with network protocols. It also gave me a understanding of data conversion and file handling.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project.
